        <h3>Snapshots and Workspaces (text editor sessions)</h3>
        <HR SIZE="3">
        <P><strong>Snapshot</strong> is a momentary copy of editor session with all files and unsaved 
            modifications. You can make a snapshot at any moment including when you are 
            closing the program and re-open it later. A shapshot contains the list of open 
            files with cursor/selection/bookmark positions and also the text of modified 
            files.</P>
        <P><strong>When to use snapshots</strong>: very often I have a bunch open of 
            windows and have no desire to save all of them in individual files. It would be 
            nice to have backup for them but in one single file so snapshot is an ideal 
            solution for that.</P>
        <P>Snapshot has simplified save/open interface. You just use the command 
            &quot;Snapshot-&gt;Quick Save&quot; and the program generates the snapshot name and creates 
            it in the <a href="autosave.htm">Backup folder</a>, you can open it using Quick 
            Snapshot recent menu. The snapshot will disappear from the menu after opening 
            however will be still available in the Backup folder.</P>
        <P><strong>Copy and Paste</strong> can be useful for quick cloning your working 
            session and also moving from old to new version of the program.</P>
        <P><strong><a href="autosave.htm">Autosave snapshot</a></strong> is a backup 
            solution. You can open it from the Backup folder using &quot;Snapshot-&gt;Open AS / 
            QS...&quot;</P>
        <P><strong>Workspace</strong> is extended version of a snapshot. It can be open only by a single 
            instance of the program and serves to save the state of this instance.</P>
        <P><strong>When to use workspaces</strong>: they suit for prolonged work on some 
            feature or activity.</P>
        <p>The toolbar has 4 buttons designated to open and save a workspace or a snapshot. 
        Additionally recent workspace/snapshot dropdown menu can be activated by clicking 
        on the arrow-down of those buttons.
