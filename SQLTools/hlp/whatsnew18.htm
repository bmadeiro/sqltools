        <h3>What&#39;s new in 1.8</h3>
        <HR SIZE="3">
        <h4>All database operations have been moved into background thread</h4>
        <P>SQLTools is essentially multi-threaded application with all database calls moved 
            in the background. That allow non-blocking behavior and quicker response time 
            for some operation like open connection.</P>
        <H4><a href="autosave.htm">Autosave</a></H4>
        <P>Any program can crash including an operation system, finally SQLTools has 
            autosave and restore to prevent editor data loss.</P>
        <H4><a href="snapshots_and_workspaces.htm">Snapshots and Workspaces (text editor sessions)</a></H4>
        <P>Snapshot is a momentary copy of editor session with all files and unsaved 
            modifications. You can make a snapshot at any moment including when you are 
            closing the program and re-open it later.</P>
        <P>Workspace is extended version of a snapshot. It can be open only by a single 
            instance of the program and serves to save the state of this instance.</P>

        <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">There are a situations when you cannot modify your environment 
            variables like PATH or ORACLE_HOME but that might be necessary in order to make 
            SQLTools work properly.</P>
        <H4><a href="History.txt">The complete list of changes...</a></H4>
